# Peptide-Spectrum-Consistency-Checker

This Python script identifies linear peptides that are consistent with a given experimental mass spectrum, a common task in computational proteomics.

# Overview
Given:

* A set of peptide candidates (amino acid sequences);

* An experimental mass spectrum (a set of integer mass values);

The script checks which peptides have a total mass matching one of the values in the spectrum.

How It Works
* Each peptide is translated into its total monoisotopic mass, using a standard amino acid mass table.

* The total mass is compared against the given spectrum.

* Peptides with matching masses are considered consistent.

# Example
```
spectrum = {0, 71, 99, 101, 103, 128, 129, 199, 200, 204, 227, 230, 231, 298, 303, 328, 330, 332, 333}

peptides = ["TVQ", "AVQ", "ETC", "TCQ", "QCV", "TCE"]
```

# Output:

TVQ
AVQ
ETC
TCQ
QCV
TCE
